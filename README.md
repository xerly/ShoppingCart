# Shopping Cart
### Simple shopping cart using the drag &amp; drop method with Vanilla Javascript

In this RETO 2 I had to create a list of items/products with their respective prices and with a drag & drop method put them in a shopping cart
where it has to be uploaded at the time the products are dropped there.

### *- What I did -*

I designed a template of products with their own image of the product, it's price and an "add to cart" button.
So the user can both, drag the image to the shopping cart and/or click the "add to cart" button to add the product in the basket.
Each time the user drags the image and drops it, the product gets inserted in the list of products selected (in the shopping cart).
Also the total price amount gets automatically updated to purchase
